Today I learned that the CharacterController is a 3D object that will not work with the boxcollider2d. 

https://answers.unity.com/questions/1432668/character-controller-wont-collide-with-anything.html
The CharacterController is a 3D object. From the (3D) physics point of view the CharacterController 
is an upright CapsuleCollider. Of course it doesn't work with 2d colliders. The 2d and 3d physics 
systems have no relation to each other. for 2d physics Unity uses "Box2d", for 3d physics it uses 
"PhysX". If you want to use the CharacterController you have to use 3d colliders (SphereCollider, 
CapsuleCollider, BoxCollider, MeshCollider).

Set up respawnPoint OntriggerEnter2d and solve issue of respawning not working
Thank you ceandros. I found the problem, actually it was an update 
made on march 2019. CharacterController was overriding GameObject position. 
Going to Edit > Project Settings > Physics, then click on the checkmark "Auto Sync Transforms" the issue was solved.
