Today I learned that the CharacterController is a 3D object that will not work with the boxcollider2d. 

https://answers.unity.com/questions/1432668/character-controller-wont-collide-with-anything.html
The CharacterController is a 3D object. From the (3D) physics point of view the CharacterController 
is an upright CapsuleCollider. Of course it doesn't work with 2d colliders. The 2d and 3d physics 
systems have no relation to each other. for 2d physics Unity uses "Box2d", for 3d physics it uses 
"PhysX". If you want to use the CharacterController you have to use 3d colliders (SphereCollider, 
CapsuleCollider, BoxCollider, MeshCollider).
